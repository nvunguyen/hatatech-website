            <p class="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                To empower small and medium-sized agricultural businesses with cutting-edge, affordable automation technology. We believe that technology should
                break down barriers, not build them, allowing local farmers and processors to compete globally in efficiency and quality.

                <p class="text-gray-600">
                    Founded by a team of agricultural engineers and local farmers, Hatatech started in a small workshop with the goal of solving a single
                    problem: the labor-intensive nature of tropical crop processing. Today, we ship specialized tools across four continents, always maintaining
                    our commitment to quality, durability, and user-friendly design.

                <p class="text-gray-600">
                    Every machine is designed for energy efficiency and longevity. We focus on tools that minimize waste during processing and promote
                    responsible resource use, helping our clients achieve both profitability and ecological responsibility.
